The 8-Puzzle Solver is an AI-based program that finds the optimal solution for the classic 8-puzzle problem using the A search algorithm* with the Manhattan Distance heuristic. The goal is to arrange the tiles into the correct order by sliding them into the empty space while minimizing the number of moves.
